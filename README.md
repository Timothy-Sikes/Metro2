# Metro2

This is my attempt at the same project, but with Node.js!  Available at https://nodejs.org/en/

# Instructions:

* Download and install node at https://nodejs.org/en/
* Run npm run watch
* Navigate to http://localhost:3000

# Notes
  This is my first attempt at node, and also my second implementation of this project, so I didn't get everything completely functional. I started this at 1:00 pm on Sunday, so my time was a little limited.
  Things that are missing include:
* Getting jquery properly loaded (and thus, the interplay between the "submit" button and actually going to the relevant page)
* Serving up static .css and .js files. (A previous technology I used changed the way this was served and I never had the time to actually change it back.)
* Using promises correctly to gather data from the API.
