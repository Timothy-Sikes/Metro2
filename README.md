# Metro2

This is my attempt at the same project, but with Node.js!  Available at https://nodejs.org/en/

# Instructions:

* Download and install node at https://nodejs.org/en/
* Run npm run watch
* Navigate to http://localhost:3000

# Notes
  This is my first attempt at node, and also my second implementation of this project, so I didn't get everything completely functional.
